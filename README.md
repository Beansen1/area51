Convenience Store Kiosk System

The Convenience Store Kiosk System is a computer-based self-service application that’s designed to streamline and automate essential operations within a small convenience store. It will allow customers to independently check out items and manage basic inventory records like adding or deleting an item. This system is intended to replace traditional manual processes, utilizing an SQLite database to store product inventory, sales transactions, and customer purchase data. The system will be developed by the proponents using Python and will strictly follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

In Scope:
- Add, edit, and view product records
- Customer self-checkout simulation
- Inventory level tracking
- Local SQLite storage

Out of Scope:
- Integration with physical payment methods (e.g., credit card readers)
- Advanced data analytics and forecasting features
- Integration with external store management software (ERP)
- Mobile or Web-based version

Before running make sure to input these in the terminal:

python -m venv .venv

.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

python -m pip install -r requirementsnito.txt

NOTE: admin username and password
